Code and data for CCMC Scoreboard Time of arrival forecasts analysis

The following is taken from the header information of the .R script....

# Driver routine to read in the results of the CCMC shock arrival times forecasts, perform some statistics on them, 
# and make the figures found in the paper: 
#
# "Forecasting the Arrival Time of Coronal Mass Ejections: Analysis of the CCMC CME Scoreboard"
#
# to be, or already published in "Space Weather".

# This is intended to provide support for the analysis presented in the aforementioned paper; however,
# you are free to take/modify this code for their own purpose(s). 
# 
# Disclaimer: 
#
# It includes all the gory details and transient changes so that I, or someone else 
# can recover all/earlier results. It's not supposed to be "production" code. 
#
# Please contact Pete Riley (pete@predsci.com) with any issues or suggested changes - 
# I'm more than happy to help set this up if you want to test YOUR forecasts against 
# those in the CCMC Scoreboard. 
#
# At some point, I'll update this to be a general purpose tool for testing/assessing other 
# forecasts to try to improve on the ones that are currently in the CCMC.

# Dependencies: Uses some R packages that are not installed by default. 
# You'll be prompted to install (via error messages) if you don't have them.
